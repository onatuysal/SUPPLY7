- **Repository Pattern**  
- **Firebase Firestore** (dynamic data storage)  
- **Firebase Storage** (image handling)  
- **Firebase Auth** (secure login)

Directory plan:

/ui → Screens (Activities/Fragments), Adapters
/viewmodel → ViewModels
/data → Models, Firebase Repositories
/utils → Helper classes and extensions
/design → Icons, images, branded assets

## 🧪 Git & Collaboration Workflow

### Branch Strategy (Feature-Based)
- `main` — Stable, production-ready  
- `feature/backend` — Backend logic, Firebase integration  
- `feature/ui` — UI, layouts, visual design  
- `feature/chat` — Real-time messaging system  
- `design-assets` — Visual design files from VCD team  

### Workflow Rules
1. Always **pull** before starting work  
2. Create/update work under the correct `feature/` branch  
3. Commit frequently with clear messages  
4. Push your feature branch  
5. Open a **Pull Request** to `main`  
6. Merge after review
